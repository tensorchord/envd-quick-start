# Tutorial

envd is a container-based development environment management tool for data scientists.

üêç **No docker, only python** - Write python code to build the development environment, we help you take care of Docker.

üñ®Ô∏è **Built-in jupyter/vscode** - Jupyter and VSCode remote extension are the first-class support.

‚è±Ô∏è **Save time** - Better cache management to save your time, keep the focus on the model, instead of dependencies

‚òÅÔ∏è **Local & cloud** - Run the environment locally or in the cloud, without any code change

üê≥ **Container native** - Leverage container technologies but no need to learn how to use them, we optimize it for you

ü§ü **Infrastructure as code** - Describe your project in a declarative way, 100% reproducible

Let's discover **envd in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new envd environment**.

### What you'll need

- Docker (20.10.0 or above)

### Install envd

You can download the binary from the [latest release page](https://github.com/tensorchord/envd/releases/latest), and add it in `$PATH`.

After the download, please run `envd bootstrap` to bootstrap.

### Create an envd environment

Please clone the [`envd-quick-start`](https://github.com/tensorchord/envd-quick-start):

```
git clone https://github.com/tensorchord/envd-quick-start.git
```

The build manifest `build.envd` looks like:

```python
def build():
    base(dev=True)
    install.conda()
    install.python()
    install.python_packages(name = [
        "numpy",
    ])
    shell("fish")
```

Then please run the command below to setup a new environment:

```
cd envd-quick-start && envd up
```

```bash
$ cd envd-quick-start && envd up

‚¨¢ [envd]‚ùØ # You are in the container-based environment!
```

### Play with the environment

You can run `ssh envd-quick-start.envd` to reconnect if you exit from the environment. Or you can execute `git` or `python` commands inside.

```bash
$ python demo.py
[2 3 4]
$ git fetch
$
```

### Setup jupyter notebook

Please edit the `build.envd` to enable jupyter notebook:

```python
def build():
    base(dev=True)
    install.conda()
    install.python()
    install.python_packages(name = [
        "numpy",
    ])
    shell("fish")
    config.jupyter(password="", port=8888)
```

You can get the endpoint of jupyter notebook via `envd get envs`.

```bash
$ envd up --detach
$ envd get env
